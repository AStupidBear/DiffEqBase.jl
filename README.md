DiffEqBase.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem. It holds the
common types and utility functions which are shared by other component packages
in order to reduce the size of dependencies. Users interested in using this
functionality should check out [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl)
